## Hi there, my name is Tyler, better known as Pixel
I am a student currently studying networking. 
I have a passion for modded minecraft and often make modpacks as seen on my linked curseforge profile.
I decided recently that to stop my modpacks from getting too boring or repetitive, I should branch out into actually programming my own mods.
With this, I got approached by Kinetic Hosting to semi-sponsor my projects.
Although I havent uploaded a modpack in about 2 years, I have been developing the skills by making modpacks for my private circle and I am confident to come back.
I am still in the very beginning of my adventure I feel, even with almost 14 years of minecraft experience (started playing 2010, yes I was 4).
I am still very, very new to Java, and only just familiarising myself with JavaScript. I have experience in Python, HTML and CSS as I have been taught with the langauges.

My current project is a minecraft mod that completely revamps the nature in minecraft by adding many new plants, trees, animals, appropriate to each biome.
This will include underbrush to forests, making them look and feel more dense.
Nature naturally spreads, mainly different vines and possibly forests grow.
New tree chopping system.
Plenty of different blocks.
The project is not designed as a "biome" mod, its more of an overhaul mod. It is aimed towards forests mainly, and forests will be what I work on first.
The rest of the biomes will likely be overhauled once I have completed the forest overhauls.
A lot of the biome overhauls will also be based on the many different forests of my home country New Zealand ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿.
More information will be in the discord which I have linked in my profile. This will be in #pixels-project-development.

If you want to reach me, the discord linked in my profile will be where that is.
If you want to check out the modded projects I have made already, the curseforge link is also in my profile.
To support my projects, subscribe to my channel, also linked in my profile, and use my code "Swampy" at checkout on your Kinetic Hosting servers for a 15% off your first month. 

One final note:
As shameless as these discount code plugs are, as someone who is studying networking, what Kinetic Hosting have done in terms of their server hosting is above all else. They genuinely provide incredibly decent
hardware at a really good price and I would definitely recommend. If you have any issues, please go to their discord where their amazing support staff will help you.
